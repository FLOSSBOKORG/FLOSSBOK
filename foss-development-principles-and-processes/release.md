# Release

The major different between open source projects and proprietary projects is the lack of centralized control over the development team. When there is a new release, we can see the difference more clearly. The proprietary project team tends to focus on the upcoming release. So they would put aside currently developing new features and non-critical bug fixing until the release is finished. However, the people in open source project team are more casual. The ones who are not interested in the upcoming release may still want to continue regular development work. In this situation, because development doesn't stop, open source release processes tend to take longer, but be less disruptive, than commercial release processes. For a mature software with several different releases being maintained simultaneously, the project is in a permanent state of minor road repair. There are always a couple of lanes closed; a consistent but low level of background inconvenience is always being tolerated by the development group as a whole, so that releases get made on a regular schedule.

Release work is usually the most noticeable non-development task that happens in parallel with development. The methods described in the following sections are mostly toward enabling releases.

# Communication Mechanisms

**Communication Mechanisms:**

In order to communicate between team members, there are several ways to communicate between team members : email , forum, gitter, slack.

All good open-source projects give people a place to go to ask questions, and the easiest way to achieve that is by setting up a mailing list. 

Setting up a mailing list with [Yahoo Groups](http://groups.yahoo.com/) or [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/) is easy and free. Make sure to do that before announcing the project’s availability, and actively encourage people to use the mailing list to ask questions. Link to the mailing list prominently on the website \(if you have one\) or in the documentation.

The other important part of running a mailing list is to actively monitor it. Nothing is more frustrating for end users or contributors than being ignored. If you’ve set up a mailing list, take the time to monitor it and respond to people who ask questions. This is the best way to foster a community of developers around the project. Getting a decent amount of traffic onto the mailing list can take some time, but it’s worth the effort. Offer advice to people who want to contribute; suggest to people to file tickets when appropriate \(don’t let the mailing list turn into a bug tracker!\); and use the feedback you get from the mailing list to improve documentation.

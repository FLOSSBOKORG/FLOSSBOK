# FLOSSBOK

FLOSSBOK course for OSS course @ CMU-SV.

FLOSSBOK defines the suitable Body of Knowledge related to Free, Libre, and Open Source Software \(FLOSS\).

Following the approach used for SWEBOK and PMBOK, the goal of FLOSSBOK is to identify topics that can be used for courses and individual study of FLOSS-related topics. The work includes a deep outline of FLOSS related topics, backed by citations to curated resources with the appropriate content.
